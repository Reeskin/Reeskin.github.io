<!--History of Album writing-->
<h3>Albums and EPs</h3>
<p>In the band's 16 year history, all of their songs have been written and composed almost entirely by Brian and Matthew. The only outside input they have recieved is when trying to add an instrument they aren't experienced with to a track - such as their songs that include trumpet.

In total, the band has released seven studio albums and 10 Eps (with an 11th being released September 2nd).</p>
