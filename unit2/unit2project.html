<!-- Ant Facts -->
  <p> Ants may be small in stature, but they are capable of much more than people realize. Comparitivly, if humans were able to accomplish the same feats as ants, we would be actual superheros (when their size is taken into account). Some of these ant abilities are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li type = a> Ants are one of the strongest creature relative to their size. A single ant can carry 50 times its own bodyweight. This would be like the average man casually lifting 9,500 pounds. </li>
    <li type = a> The bullet ant has the most painful sting of any insect according to the Schmidt Sting Index - an index built around a man letting insects bite/sting him and rating them on an exponential scale. </li>
    <li  type = a> Ants are the longest living insects. Some species of ant queens are able to stay alive up to 30 years. </li>
  </ul>
